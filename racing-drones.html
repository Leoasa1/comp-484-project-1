						That was the slogan for our newest approach to creating
						this piece of art! Fully protected electronics, fully
						illuminated, coupled with all the latest and greatest
						electronics we can offer. Months of engineering went
						into this BNF and all the lessons learned before, making
						sure that beginners, as well as experienced pilots,
						would fully enjoy using the new Nazgul Evoque from the
						first second they use it.
					</p>
					<p>
						360-degree illumination for day and night. Maybe the
						prettiest BNF out there but also a practical one. The
						bottom light indicates battery voltage, a quick check
						gives you a hint of the voltage still remaining; Never
						lift off with an empty battery again. Installed LED
						wires in the side panels and the bottom of the arms are
						also illuminated and gives you some style at the next
						night's race.

					<h2>Chimera7 Pro 6S</h2>
					<img

					/>
					<p>
						Introducing what has been requested for too long
						already! A super-efficient iFlight 7.5inch Long-Range
						bird that can go where you couldn't go before and can
						carry bigger batteries to get the flight time to surf
						the swiss alps if you want! A super stiff frame for
						minimum resonance and XING2 2809 motors for maximum
						7.5inch prop control. Fly big batteries top-mounted, or
						even bigger batteries bottom-mounted, 6cells recommended
						or 5cells for slow cruising. But whatever style you fly,
						a Lipo or Lion pack will just do the job. Recommended 5S
						3.000mAh above (slow cruising) or 6S 2.500mAh above.
					</p>
					<p>
						GPS functionality to find your way back and Betaflight
						GPS Rescue mode ready to setup (default OFF to prevent
						unexpected behavior; Setup instructions included).
						Vertical and horizontal TBS Crossfire antenna mounts are
						included to cover you and your antenna dead-ends just in
						case. GoPro universal TPU bottom stand included; fits
						your original GoPro bracket and our TPU GoPro protectors
						(additional).
