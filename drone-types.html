						<p>
							Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aircraft
							system refers to a drone. It resembles a flying
							robot in that it can be commanded remotely or fly on
							its own thanks to software-controlled flight plans
							that are integrated into the system and operate with
							sensors and a global positioning system (GPS).
							Drones come in a range of shapes and sizes and are
							employed for a number of tasks.

						<h2>1. Multi-Rotor Drones</h2>
						<p>
							The simplest and least expensive method for keeping
							a "eye in the sky" is to use a multi-rotor drone.
							They are ideal for aerial photography and
							surveillance since they also provide you more
							control over positioning and framing. They are
							called multi-rotor because they have more than one
							motor, more commonly tricopters (3 rotors),
							quadcopters (4 rotors), hexacopters (6 rotors) and
							octocopters (8 rotors), among others. Quadcopters
							are by far the most common type of multi-rotor
							drone.

						<h2>3. Single-Rotor Drones</h2>
						<p>
							Drones with a single rotor are robust and
							long-lasting. They resemble helicopters in terms of
							construction and design. A single-rotor aircraft has
							only one rotor, which is similar to one large
							spinning wing, and an additional tail rotor for
							direction and stability control. The efficiency of a
							single-rotor helicopter is far higher than that of a
							multi-rotor, and this advantage grows if the drone
							is gas-powered for even greater endurance.

						<h2>Other Significant Drone Types</h2>

						<!-- Summary element is used to display other drone types -->
						<ol>
							<li>
								<details>
									<summary><b>Small Drones</b></summary>
									<p>
										These drone types are used for
										recreational purposes; they cannot
										perform commercial functions that other
										drone models carry out. Small drones are
										too light and lack the stability
										required for accurately capturing
										images.
									</p>
								</details>
							</li>
							<li>
								<details>
									<summary><b>Micro Drones</b></summary>
									<p>
										These are small drones, but they can
										still provide valuable intelligence
										because of their micro cameras. The
										British military commonly uses this
										drone, and it’s called the Black Hornet.
										Black Hornets can fly up to 25 minutes
										(single charge) and have a range of up
										to one mile.
									</p>
								</details>
							</li>
							<li>
								<details>
									<summary><b>Tactical Drones</b></summary>
									<p>
										These drones are large without being
										bulky. Equipped with GPS technology and
										infrared cameras, they measure 4.5 feet
										and weigh 4.2 lbs. They are often used
										for surveillance work.
									</p>
								</details>
							</li>
							<li>
								<details>
									<summary>
										<b>Reconnaissance Drones</b>
									</summary>
									<p>
										These drones measure approximately 16
										feet in length, over 2200 pounds, and
										hover for 52 hours at 35,000 feet. They
										can be launched from the ground and are
										known as High Altitude Long Endurance
										drones (HALE) and Medium Altitude Long
										Endurance drones (MALE).

							<li>
								<details>
									<summary><b>GPS Drones</b></summary>
									<p>
										This drone type links to satellites via
										a GPS hookup to map out the rest of
										their flight, collecting data that can
										be extracted to make informed decisions.
